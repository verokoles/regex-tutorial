## Regex Components
Regular Expressions are also considered literals, calls for wrapping in special characters like slashes (/).
### Anchors
Anchors are the wrapping symbols which indicate the start and finish of the regular expression. In the code snippet for validating a user's email address, the regex starts with the ^ and ends with the $ symbol.
### Quantifiers
The different quantifiers in this snippet include brackets, {} as well as the plus sign, +. <br>
Brackets signify

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match
